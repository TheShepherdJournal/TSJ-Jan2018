Nate Badour shared photos of the military tank he carved out of snow. The snow sculpture sits in front of his house. He writes, “I have been doing snow sculptures each winter since my son was 1 he is now 6. My inspiration is usually whatever he is into that year from lightning McQueen, race cars, Thomas the train, and minions.”

Badour said that it took him two hours to build the tank sculpture and snow bunker for his son. He used a shovel, steel dustpan, and a putty knife to shape and carve the snow.
