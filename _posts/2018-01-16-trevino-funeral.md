From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Shepherd-Police-Department-205632619455314/?hc_ref=ARToZERiXHAqXEp2hTc5ZL6aUhmzeDo3bBHstuSTa69QCrSzKRTuHS3tB5EVP0pLHPg&amp;fref=nf&amp;hc_location=group">Shepherd Police Department</a>:

<i>Today we were able to join about 60 officers and lots of family friends at the funeral of retired Gratiot County Sheriff's Department Deputy Lee Trevino. As 20 or 25 patrol vehicles with our overhead lights activated traveled to the cemetery it was amazing to see EVERY vehicle pull over for us, may giving us a thumbs up as we drove by. There was one gentleman that caught my attention, not too far from the church. He was in the later years of his life, he stood at the end of his driveway with his ball cap over his heart. I have no idea if he knew Deputy Trevino or not...maybe he just knew it was the right thing to do.</i>

<i>It is NEVER enjoyable to put that elastic band around your badge...but it is an honor to pay final respects to a member of our law enforcement family.</i>
