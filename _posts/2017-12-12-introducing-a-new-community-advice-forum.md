After I watched the video that Jay Gross posted and read some of the reactions, I wanted to try to offer something to the community which might help make it easier for people to get connected.

Tonight, I added a <a href="http://shepherdjournal.shepherdmaplesyrupfestival.com/questions/ask">questions and answer forum</a> to the Shepherd Journal website. Now, anybody can get advice from the community by anonymously posting a question, and visitors on the site can then respond with answers.

Responses are voted on, allowing the original question poster to pick an answer based on its rating.

I'm inviting everybody to give it a try, and then share their feedback.
