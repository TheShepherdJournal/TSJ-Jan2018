<blockquote>Congrats to our SMS High Flier Award winner, Mrs. Cheryl Jerry. She spent countless hours planning and preparing for our 6th grade students to have a phenomenal<span class="text_exposed_show">experience at Camp Hartley this past week. These students have memories that will last a lifetime and Mrs. Jerry did all of the work behind the scenes to make it special for every child and staff chaperone who was a part of it. There's no better time than now to be a Blue Jay!!</span></blockquote>
