The theme for the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival parade, taking place on Sunday, April 29 at 2:30 p.m., will be “Celebrate Sixty” in honor of the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival sixtieth anniversary.

In years past, the parade has drawn large crowds and served as a bookend to the weekend long festival. Entries have included clowns, bands, classic cars, floats, jugglers, and emergency vehicles.

Each year, a Grand Marshall is selected from the community to lead the parade.
