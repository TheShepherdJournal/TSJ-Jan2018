Friends of the Library will be donating free children's books on Saturday, April 28, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. during what it is calling the “Free Children’s Book Giveaway.” Volunteers will be located in front of the elementary school. If the weather is bad, they will be located inside the Shepherd Elementary School.

The book giveaway will be taking place during the same time as the Children’s Village.
