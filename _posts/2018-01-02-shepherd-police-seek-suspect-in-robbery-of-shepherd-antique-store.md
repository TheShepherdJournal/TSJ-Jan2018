The Shepherd Police Department is seeking information on a robbery that took place Thursday, December 28 inside the Antiques &amp; Uniques Marketplace in Shepherd. According to the business’ Facebook page, the robbery took place between 7 and 8 a.m.

“The male thief targeted coins and cash only. This definitely was not his first [time] in the store and he is experienced with break ins,” a post on the Facebook page stated. “He wore a ski mask, gloves, and brought [his] own crowbar/pry bar. We ask that if you were near the area and may have seen something suspicious, please contact Luke Sawyer at the Shepherd Police Department.”
