The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1775675642450996&amp;id=205632619455314">Shepherd Police Department</a> has launched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BNl53CfMiB6wX_I7-7RUg/featured?disable_polymer=1">YouTube channel</a>. The initial post promised video of either a car chase or Chief Sawyer being tazed. The majority of commenters asked for the tazing video, so that will be the first video posted on the channel.
