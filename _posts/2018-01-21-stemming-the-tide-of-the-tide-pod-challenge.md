The Internet has impacted society in a lot of positive ways, through technological advancements, networking, and crowd sourcing. But, every once in a while there is something which surfaces which is definitely not positive. The "Tide Pod Challenge" is one of them. From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgross811/posts/10155753158088445">Jay Gross</a>:
<blockquote>Addressed all my classes on this yesterday...

“"It can go through skin, it can eat through eyes, it can eat through mouth, it can eat through the esophagus and through the lungs to the point where deaths have been reported," Dr. Gomez warned.”

I have no words...</blockquote>
<!--more-->The "challenge" is to put a Tide Pod in your mouth, like it's a dare or something I guess. Unlike the ice bucket challenge, which seemed a little strange but grew on someone once they understood it better, the behavior that's being encouraged so super dangerous and reckless...there really are no words for it.

All I know about the pods (we also use pods for our dishwasher) is that you toss them in when you're doing the laundry or the dishes, and the chemicals they contain are slowly released. Perhaps it's the same principle as medicine capsules.

Today, I saw a news report stating that a student at <a href="http://fox13now.com/2018/01/20/usu-student-transported-to-hospital-after-reported-tide-pod-overdose/">Utah State University was taken to the hospital after ingesting a Tide Pod</a>.
<blockquote>Eric Warren, director of media relations at USU, said a call came in late Saturday afternoon about an incident at on-campus housing.

USU Police initially called the incident a “Tide Pod overdose”, but Warren said the student in question ingested a Tide Pod.

The student was taken to a local hospital, and Sunday the student was recovering in a hospital. Their exact condition is unknown.

Warren said it’s unclear what motivated the student to ingest the Tide Pod, but he said: “For students and members of our university who are feeling overwhelmed, we have services available. There are people here to talk to you.”</blockquote>
We can blame teenagers for being..well, teenagers (although they should know better). We can blame the Internet for propagating the idea that this is somehow cool or worth the risk. But, what I think would be better is to try to figure out what's really going on. Can't young people think for themselves? Do they know the difference between something that's safe, and something that's not? Or, do they not care?

I was wondering what everybody else thought about this trend.
