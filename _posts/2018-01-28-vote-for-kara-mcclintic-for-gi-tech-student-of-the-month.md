<em>From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgross811/posts/10155790651263445">Jay Gross</a>:</em>
<blockquote>Hey There Shepherd!

Ready to step up???

Our Vice Principal Carrie Winn Gauthier informed me that our own Kara McClintic was up for GI TECH Student of the Month!

All you have to do is click the link and vote for her.

She is an amazing young lady who does so many things, the latest is passing her boards to become a fourth generation fire fighter!

This young woman ROCKS!!!</blockquote>
