Rachel Mathers, Katelyn Hutchinson, Kylie Hutchinson & Amber Gall ran 9:18.06 in very exciting fashion to beat the State Record of 9:22. The runner up team Hart ran a great race and also went under the record. This was the first race of the day at the State Meet and set the tone for what was an amazing day for Shepherd Track & Field! 2017 was a great year for our program and we are looking forward to an exciting 2018!
