With the start of the new year, it is almost expected that people will begin to discuss, or ask about, their new year's resolutions. If you’re still trying to decide on your goals for the year, or maybe you’re looking for an additional challenge, consider this suggestion from Steven Covieo:

*Make no resolutions. Instead join me in doing something new, different, or deliberately kind every day in 2018.*

*Try a new food, visit a new place, start a conversation with a stranger, learn a new dance move, learn a word in a foreign language, juggle fruit, walk a new route to the mailbox, create something - a poem, a painting, a song, anything.*

*Try something or go someplace new. Do something differently. Be intentionally kind.*

*I've been doing this for several years now, but have yet to make it an entire year... perhaps with each other's help and support we can do what l cannot.*

I thought that this was a great idea, so I've started a group on Facebook where members will be able to support each other as they try new things. It’s called [The Big Pivot 2018](https://www.facebook.com/groups/152460738809365/?hc_ref=ARS3YePQyaAB1j4n4xzggc9J3vsTk6aY0HrwvRejJhyD1k8cNBDoT7F4iQpBqhoQOjE). This is a place where you can post an update when you try something new, or ask questions if there is something you would like to change but you’re not sure how.
