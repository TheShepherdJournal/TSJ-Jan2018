From the Shepherd Middle School Facebook page, "We hope everyone had a great holiday break and we look forward to seeing all of you tomorrow back at school!! Please make sure to dress warm and to be ready to learn right at 8am...as we know that you all are excited to wake up early again!!

Remember, too, that we will be having another Blue Jay Renaissance rally day in the near future. Make sure that you qualify by achieving high academic marks, attend school, and also by being a good person. Academics, Attendance, and Attitude all represent what we expect at SMS and remember, There's no better time than now to be a Blue Jay!!
