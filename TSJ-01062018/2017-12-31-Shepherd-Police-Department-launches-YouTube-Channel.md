The [Shepherd Police Department](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1775675642450996&id=205632619455314) has launched a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BNl53CfMiB6wX_I7-7RUg/featured?disable_polymer=1). The initial post promised video of either a car chase or Chief Sawyer being tazed. The majority of commenters asked for the tazing video, so that will be the first video posted on the channel.
